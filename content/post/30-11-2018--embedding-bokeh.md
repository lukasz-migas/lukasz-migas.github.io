# Interactive mass spectrum
You can easily export annotated mass spectrum and share it with the scientific world! Here is an example of a mass spectrum of a NIST antibody that you can zoom-in, move around, hover-over and more.

### Figure with widgets
You can also annotate figure with multiple widgets that can improve the visualisation experience. It might be desirable to give readers/consumers the possibility to adjust the figure to their preferences. The example below shows how labels can be removed, their size can be adjusted and the behaviour of the hover tool can be altered.

# Interactive heatmap
You can easily export heatmaps and share them with the scientific world!

### Figure with widgets
You can also annotate figure with multiple widgets that can improve the visualisation experience. It might be desirable to give readers/consumers the possibility to adjust the figure to their preferences. The example below shows how the colormap of the figure can be adjusted to bee more colorblind friendly and the reader can change the colormap too.
