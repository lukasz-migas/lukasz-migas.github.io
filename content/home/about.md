# Biography

I am PhD student (soon to be PostDoc) in biological mass spectrometry in the [Barran](https://www.mbc.manchester.ac.uk/barrangroup/) group, at the University of Manchester. My research focuses on studying proteins and protein complexes using mass spectrometry and ion mobility-mass spectrometry methods. During my PhD I have developed interest in software development and since, have created [ORIGAMI](https://lukasz-migas.github.io/ORIGAMI/), an open-source software suite for analysis of MS and IM-MS datasets. 

I have also spent time investigating carbohydrates, developing software for analysis of imaging mass spectrometry (soon to be available..) as well as in-house tools to calculate collision cross sections and perform molecular dynamics simulations.
