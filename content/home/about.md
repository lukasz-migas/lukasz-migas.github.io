# Biography

I am a Postdoctral researcher in the [Van de Plas lab](http://vandeplaslab.tudelft.nl/) group at the Delft University of
Technology. My research focuses on developing new tools to study ion mobility (IM) and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS)
datasets, however, I am interesting in anything to do with mass spectrometry and signal processing.

Before moving to Delft, I've done a PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Barran](https://www.mbc.manchester.ac.uk/barrangroup/).
During my PhD I've mostly studied carbohydrates, proteins, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and focused on developing
a number of computational tools that enabled improved data acquisition rates on Waters Synapt platform and in-depth
interrogation of MS and IM-MS datasets. During my PhD years, I became interested in software development, and created
[ORIGAMI](https://lukasz-migas.github.io/ORIGAMI/).
