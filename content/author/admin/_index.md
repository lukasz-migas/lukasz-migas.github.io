I am a Postdoctoral researcher in the field of imaging mass spectrometry currently working in the Van de Plas lab based at TU Delft.
Before I've migrated to imaging mass spectrometry, I've worked in the lab of Prof. [Barran](https://www.mbc.manchester.ac.uk/barrangroup/),
studying carbohydrates, intrinisically disordered proteins as well developing software for native MS and IM-MS fields.
During my PhD I've developed [ORIGAMI](https://lukasz-migas.github.io/ORIGAMI/) which is an open-source software suite for analysis of MS and IM-MS datasets.

I have also spend significant amount of my time developing various tools for performing MD simulations, calculating collision cross sections,
as well as visualising data.
